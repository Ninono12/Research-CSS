          <h2>Research on the Risk of Violence against Women</h2>
          <p>
            The document aims to identify and evaluate the risks of violence
            against women, respond promptly to cases, and provide relevant
            advocacy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The overall findings of the study indicate that factors such as
            poverty, unemployment, substance abuse, and gender stereotypes will
            both, contribute to and cause violence. Consequently, to enhance a
            secure environment, it is important to concentrate on two primary
            directions: (i) improvement of existing support programs for victims
            of violence/domestic violence (enhancing diversity, expansion,
            accessibility); (ii) Strengthening communication (Increasing public
            awareness of the different forms and expressions of violence,
            providing guidance on responding to such incidents, encouraging the
            coordinated participation of various agencies and actors and
            actively collaborating with relevant organizations).
          </p>
          <h3>Women’s sense of security:</h3>
          <p>
            The study exclusively surveyed women, revealing that their overall
            perception of safety is moderate (Mean=3.1). When assessing the
            quality of security, the respondents predominantly emphasized the
            number “3”. Data analysis underscored several significant challenges
            to personal security, including unemployment, poverty, domestic
            violence, and the inevitability of migration.
          </p>
          <h3>Forms of violence:</h3>
          <p>
            A considerable number of women consider psychological violence as
            the most prevalent form (83.6% of cases), followed by physical
            violence (58% of cases), economic violence (56.3% of cases), and
            sexual violence (16.5% of cases). This suggests that discussing
            instances of sexual violence remains taboo in society while it may
            also be related to insufficient recognition of the issue. Despite an
            increase in women openly discussing incidents of domestic violence
            compared to previous years, many still refrain from sharing their
            personal experiences of violence. Instead, they are more comfortable
            acknowledging instances of violence in the lives of relatives. Among
            survey participants, in only 20% of cases, they admitted to
            experiencing domestic violence themselves, while in 35% of cases, a
            relative was identified as experiencing it. In 48.5% of cases,
            participants denied experiencing domestic violence in their lives.
            When naming the major causes of domestic violence, respondents more
            frequently highlighted factors they perceived as significant threats
            to personal safety. These include substance abuse of a family member
            (drugs - 51.7% of cases; alcohol - 47.6% of cases),
            traditional/stereotypical views (42.2% of cases), and a challenging
            economic situation (40.3% of cases).
          </p>
          <h3>Domestic Violence:</h3>
          <p>
            The results of the study and official statistics both point to a
            noticeable correlation between the husband's role and that of the
            family abuser (Mean = 4.0).
          </p>
          <h3>
            Awareness level about support services for victims of violence:
          </h3>
          <p>
            The level of awareness regarding support services for victims of
            violence is rated as average. 49% are informed about several support
            services for victims of violence, while 13% have complete
            information. 12% have never heard about these services, and 26% have
            limited information. The primary sources of information for women
            are non-governmental organizations (63% of cases), followed by
            social networks (57.5% of cases) and local authorities (31.4% of
            cases). The central government is the least mentioned source of
            information (12% of cases). It is encouraging that the majority of
            respondents, to protect themselves from violence, have sought or
            plan to turn to various resources, including the local government
            (45% of cases), the police (44% of cases), non-governmental
            organizations (38% of cases), and the hotline - 116,006 (29% of
            cases). The least mentioned resource is the legal aid service (only
            15% of cases). Approximately 17% of the interviewed women have never
            applied for, nor do intend to apply in the future, to any support
            service in case of violence. Among the reasons cited, the fear of
            disclosing one's problem and the anticipated negative reactions from
            others are prevalent. This highlights the societal pressures,
            judgments, and stigma that women encounter when seeking support for
            issues like violence.
          </p>
          <h3>Access to Support Services for Victims of Violence:</h3>
          <p>
            The research highlights a significant issue more than half of the
            surveyed women (55%) find support services for victims of violence
            to be either less available or completely unavailable (with 36% of
            them indicating complete unavailability). This underscores the
            importance of not only addressing the need for increased public
            awareness, as mentioned earlier but also implementing measures to
            enhance the geographic availability of support services for victims
            of violence.
